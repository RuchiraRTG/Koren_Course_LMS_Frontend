# Mock Exam Implementation - Complete Guide

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The Mock Exam and Take Exam features have been fully integrated with your existing PHP backend.

## Backend URL Configuration

The frontend is configured to use: **`http://localhost/takeExam.php`**

This matches your existing backend setup with:
- `database.php` - Database connection
- `question.php` - Question management
- `takeExam.php` - Exam flow API

## Frontend Files Updated

### 1. **MockExam.jsx** (`src/pages/MockExam.jsx`)
✅ Calls `http://localhost/takeExam.php?action=startExam`
✅ Sends exam configuration (examType, numberOfQuestions)
✅ Receives attemptToken and questions array
✅ Passes data to TakeExam via React Router state
✅ Shows loading states and error handling

### 2. **TakeExam.jsx** (`src/pages/TakeExam.jsx`)
✅ Receives questions from MockExam
✅ Renders MCQ and voice questions dynamically
✅ Supports audio player for voice questions
✅ Supports images for questions and options
✅ Tracks user answers (0-based indices)
✅ Submits to `http://localhost/takeExam.php?action=submitAnswers`
✅ Displays backend-calculated results
✅ Shows percentage, correct/incorrect counts

## Backend Response Structure (Your Actual API)

### Start Exam Response
```json

  "success": true,
  "message": "Exam started",

        "id": 9,
        "questionType": "voice",
        "questionText": "Listen to the audio...",
        "questionFormat": "normal",
        "questionImage": null,
        "answerType": "single",
        "audioLink": "https://example.com/audio/greeting.mp3",
        "difficulty": "Intermediate",
        "category": "Listening",
        "timeLimit": 30,
        "options": [
          { "text": "Hello", "image": null },
          { "text": "Goodbye", "image": null },
          { "text": "Thank you", "image": null },
          { "text": "Sorry", "image": null }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Submit Answers Request
```json
{
  "attemptToken": "e021917e1ef86aee4aecfd79a6222f4b",
  "answers": [
    { "question_id": 9, "selected_index": 0 },
    { "question_id": 12, "selected_index": 1 }
  ]
}
```

### Submit Answers Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Results calculated",
  "data": {
    "attemptToken": "e021917e1ef86aee4aecfd79a6222f4b",
    "summary": {
      "total": 10,
      "correct": 7,
      "incorrect": 3,
      "percentage": 70
    },
    "details": [
      {
        "question_id": 9,
        "question_type": "voice",
        "selected_index": 0,
        "is_correct": true,
        "correct_indices": [],
        "correct_index": 0
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Database Tables (Your Existing Schema)

Your backend already has these tables:
- ✅ `questions` - Question data
- ✅ `question_options` - Answer options (option_order: 0-3)
- ✅ `mcq_question_answers` - MCQ correct answers
- ✅ `voice_question_answers` - Voice correct answers
- ✅ `useranswers` - Auto-created for tracking attempts

## How It Works

### Flow:
1. **User clicks "Start Exam" in MockExam.jsx**
   - Frontend → `POST http://localhost/takeExam.php?action=startExam`
   - Backend → Returns attemptToken + questions array
   
2. **User answers questions in TakeExam.jsx**
   - Frontend tracks answers locally (0-based indices)
   - User can navigate between questions
   - Progress tracked (X / Total answered)

3. **User clicks "Submit Exam"**
   - Frontend → `POST http://localhost/takeExam.php?action=submitAnswers`
   - Backend → Validates token, checks answers, returns results
   - Frontend → Shows results modal with percentage and breakdown

## Key Features Implemented

✅ **Multiple Question Types**: MCQ, Voice, or Mixed exams
✅ **Audio Player**: Embedded HTML5 audio for voice questions
✅ **Image Support**: Questions and options can have images
✅ **Real-time Progress**: Shows answered vs total questions
✅ **Question Navigation**: Click numbers to jump to questions
✅ **Answer Validation**: Backend validates attempt token
✅ **Results Display**: Instant feedback with percentage
✅ **Error Handling**: Shows user-friendly error messages
✅ **Loading States**: Buttons disabled during API calls

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Start a new exam from Mock Exam page
- [ ] Verify questions load correctly
- [ ] Answer all questions
- [ ] Submit exam
- [ ] Verify results display correctly
- [ ] Try different exam types (MCQ only, Voice only, Both)
- [ ] Test with different question counts (20, 30, 50)

## Important Notes

1. **Option Indices are 0-based** - Matches your backend's `option_order` column
2. **No PHP files were created in frontend** - Uses your existing backend
3. **Backend URL is hardcoded** - Change `http://localhost/takeExam.php` if your backend is elsewhere
4. **Session-based security** - Backend validates attemptToken in PHP session
5. **CORS** - Your backend has proper CORS headers already set

## If You Need to Change Backend URL

Update both files:
- `MockExam.jsx` line ~24: Change `http://localhost/takeExam.php`
- `TakeExam.jsx` line ~50: Change `http://localhost/takeExam.php`

## Status: ✅ READY FOR TESTING

All integration is complete. The frontend now communicates with your actual PHP backend at `http://localhost/takeExam.php`.
